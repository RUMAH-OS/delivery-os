//
// Lifted VERBATIM from `rumah-admin/src/runtime-stores.ts` (the 14 exported functions over the 6 governance
// tables, migration 0052). The Postgres-specifics — `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(goalId))` for `appendCost`,
// `ON CONFLICT … DO NOTHING/DO UPDATE`, `make_interval`, the CAS `UPDATE … WHERE breaker_state='open'`, and the
// 0052 RLS + append-only / idempotency / breaker guard triggers — all live BEHIND this port (the adapter owns
// them; the organ only calls a method). The in-memory adapter in `scripts/in-memory-store.ts` proves the seam is
// genuinely DB-free.
//
// THE C12 APPEND-ONLY INVARIANT IS STRUCTURAL IN THIS INTERFACE (the load-bearing design fact):
//   the 4 APPEND-ONLY stores (goal_delta_ledger · attempt_ledger · dead_letter · portfolio_cost_ledger) expose
//   ONLY an append method + read method(s) — there is NO update/delete method on the port for any of them. A
//   consumer therefore CANNOT mutate history through this seam regardless of adapter; the 0052
//   `c12_append_only_guard` trigger is the owner-proof DB backstop, but the port itself makes the illegal
//   operation un-namable. (Only the two MUTABLE stores — circuit_breaker, idempotency_store — expose state-
//   advance methods, and those mutations are themselves constrained: the breaker is a closed→open→half_open→
//   closed CAS; consume is write-once. The TS-side cage `runtime-stores-cage.ts` pins those non-structural
//   invariants against the 0052 DDL the same way the golden-master cage pins the §4.3 state machine.)
